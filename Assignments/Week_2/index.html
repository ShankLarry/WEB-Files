    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>One of the most successful and important films of all time is 1993's
       <strong>Jurassic Park.</strong> The film is directed by
       <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/">Steven Spielberg</a>
       and based off of a novel of the same name by
       <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40604658-jurassic-park">
       Michael Chrichton.</a> At the time of its

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>The film follows a group of outside experts who are brought in to give
       their assessment of a secret, unopened, theme park built on an island
       off the coast of Costa Rica by an eccentric billionaire mogul.
       That theme park turns out to be a "biological preserve" in which extinct
       dinosaurs have been cloned and brought back to life as an attraction.
       Due to a combination of human hubris, natural disaster, and poor hiring
       decisions, the power to the park's systems is shut down and the dinosaurs
       escape their enclosures, terrorizing those on the island.</p>

    <h2>Filming and Legacy</h2>
    <p>The film is historically significant as one of the first (though not
       <em>the</em> first) to embrace computer generated imagery (CGI) as a major
       component of its special effects. While many shots used practical effects,
       such as animatronics, much of the shots showing a full dinosaur were
       completely done using CGI.</p>
    <p>The film became the start of a franchise that went on to
       spawn 6 sequels.</p>
